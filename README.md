# Data Structures Implementation

A comprehensive collection of essential data structures implemented from scratch.
This repository serves as a hands-on guide to learning and mastering the core concepts of data structures through practical coding.

**note : this project is for learning purposes only**

:smiley: **Features**

- Basic Structures: Arrays, Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular).
- Trees and Graphs: Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, Graph Traversals (DFS, BFS).
- Abstract Data Types: Stacks, Queues, Priority Queues, Deques.
- Advanced Structures: Hash Tables, Heaps, Tries, Disjoint Sets.
- Algorithms: Sorting, Searching, and Pathfinding (e.g., Dijkstra's).

:smiley: **Goals**
- To provide clear, modular code implementations.
- To include comments explaining the logic behind each function.
- To include examples and test cases for better understanding.
